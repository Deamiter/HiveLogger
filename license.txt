I am aware that the CC BY-SA 3.0 is not viewed as ideal for software, although I think it serves the purpose of allowing free modification with attribution.
If the Apitronics Bee software is licensed under a more typical license for software (i.e. GPL) in the future, I will update the license for this modified version as well.
